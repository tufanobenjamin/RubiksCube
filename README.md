# RubiksCube

This is a Processing program, which displays a rubiks bube in 3-space. 
You can scramble/solve the cube using the key commands listed below.

# Main Controls

s = Complete a 20 move random scramble.

c = Begin a command.

a = Begin an algorithm (list of commands).

u = Undo previous algorithm/move

r = Repeart previous algorithm/move

# Move Controls

white face is front, red face is right 

r = Right Face

l = Left Face

f = Front Face

b = Back Face

u = Top Face

d = Bottom Face

also r2 = 180 degree rotaion while r = 90 degree and r'=-90 degree.
